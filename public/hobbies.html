    My work is also my passion—I've been fascinated by technology, design, and creativity since childhood. However, I believe that to stay productive and effective, it's essential to switch activities and refresh the mind.

    That’s why I love spending time in nature, going for walks, and capturing beautiful moments through photography. But my biggest and most cherished hobby is fishing—there's nothing quite like the peace and excitement it brings.

    At home, I enjoy unwinding with books, music, and occasionally playing some computer games—small but enjoyable additions to my relaxation time.
